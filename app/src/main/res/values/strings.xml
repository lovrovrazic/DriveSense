        The goal of this app is to give you feedback on your driving behaviour. The score is lower if you drive aggressively or more dangerously, and higher if you drive calmly or in a safer manner.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Some safe driving techniques</h2>
        <br>• Brake and accelerate gradually
        <br>• Don’t slam on the brakes, except when necessary
        <br>• Regulate your speed based on driving conditions and speed limits
        <br>• Adjust your seat position properly
        <br>• Hold your steering wheel at 9 and 3 positions
        <br><br>
        In order for app to be able to measure the needed data from accelerometer your device needs to be positioned in vehicle as pictured below.
